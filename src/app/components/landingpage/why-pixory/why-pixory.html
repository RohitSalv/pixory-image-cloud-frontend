                            You have thousands of photos scattered across devices, cloud services, and hard drives.
                            You know that perfect sunset photo exists somewhere, but finding it means scrolling
                            through endless folders named "IMG_2847.jpg" or relying on basic date filters.
                            Traditional photo apps can't understand what's actually in your images.
